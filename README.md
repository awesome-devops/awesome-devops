### What is Devops?

DevOps is a movement. There's [no certificate, role, set of tools or prescriptive process](https://sites.google.com/a/jezhumble.net/devops-manifesto/). There's no specification, it's not a product, or job title. There's no one true voice on what DevOps is or isn't. It's about attitude, ideas, customs and behaviours. Culture, paradigms and philosophy. It's a way of thinking, a way of doing and a way of being. Practicing as well as preaching. It's a conversation. It's about taking the best experiences and sharing those with others.
